When making patches:

1. Do NOT use the back-tick character: `

2. New patches should be created in the appropriate patch directory (.../resources/db/patches/mysql
   for mysql), using the filename format +<number>~<table_name>.sql. Each table should have its on file
   and the number should start at 1 and be incremented for each additional file. (i.e. +1~settings.sql,
   +2~anime_info.sql).
   Main Devs:
     When you are finished, or are merging a PR, running ./commit in the dev (and next-master, master)
   branch will trigger the pre-commit hook which now processes these files. It first runs DbUpdate 1
   to make sure all patches are current, then it will process each new patch file one at a time
   running the SQL against the database. If any line of the patch fails the process is halted so you
   can fix it.
     If all goes well the file is renamed to the appropriate patch level, the sqlpatch setting in the
   database is updated, and it move on to the next file, if any.

3. Edit the schema files, but do not copy paste your patch files into them,
   if you had an ALTER in your patch for example, change the appropriate row(s) in the data file
   and the CREATE in the ddl file (if applicable).

4. Make sure the 'sqlpatch' setting in the settings is changed in BOTH data files. ALTER in the patch file is no longer needed.

5. MySQL and PostgreSQL have different syntax, DO NOT COPY MySQL patches into the PostgreSQL folder,
   look up the syntax first.

6. For MySQL 5.6+ Users that have converted releasesearch to InnoDB, please consider importing the
   new innodb_5.6_stopword_tbl.sql file into your main mysql database.  It will vastly improve the
   search results by making it more MyISAM similar in BOOLEAN MODE.  Instructions are in the .sql file.
