Windows users can add the GNUWin32 utilities to get many of the features available to the *nix users.
As an absolute minimum, the 'which' command must be added before any of the others can be detected.

Additionally these are recommended:

file
grep

More will be added as needed ;-)

Installing this utility is fairly easy (if you can't manage it, you probably shouldn't be running an indexer :D ).
There are two GnuWin projects, although the GnuWin64 project is only in planning stages as of this writing.
The 32 bit version is available at: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/
I would recommend the package maintainer at http://getgnuwin32.sourceforge.net/ for beginners getting started.
